# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This project allows users to explore and discover a vast collection of images from Flickr through a simple and intuitive web interface. With features like image fetching and a search bar with suggestions, this web app provides a seamless experience for users interested in exploring the Flickr photo database.
